# Project 1: Web scraping and basic summarization

The goal of this Miniproject is to extract Standard Classification of Activities from the Statistical office of the Republic of Slovenia and the eVem Web pages. The data should be exported into a UTF-8 encoded JSON file.

## Expected results

- Fully implemented and reproducible Jupyter notebook (Web_Scraping.ipynb)
- Exported UTF-8 encoded JSON file (data.json)

## Environment setup

- The distribution which was used during the development of this project is the **Anaconda distribution**
of Python.
- So, in order to setup the environment in which the **Web_Scraping.ipynb** notebook was developed, you 
need to run the following command in **Anaconda prompt**:
> conda env create -f environment.yml 

- the **environment.yml** file has also been added to the repo
- Because the notebook was created in the Anaconda distribution, most of the libraries we need (pandas,
matplotlib,etc.) were preinstalled, and only few other installs had to be made. Nevertheless, the  
**environment.yml** file contains all the packages needed to run our Jupyter notebook, so no additional 
installations are needed.
